# Binary Search

Binary search, also known as half-interval
search, logarithmic searchs, or binary chop, is a search algorithm
that finds the position of a target value within a sorted
array. Binary search compares the target value to the middle
element of the array; if they are unequal, the half in which
the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues
on the remaining half until it is successful. If the search
ends with the remaining half being empty, the target is not
in the array.
